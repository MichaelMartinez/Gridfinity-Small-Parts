# Gridfinity Small Parts Organizer

Organize your small parts in a modular and customizable version of the [small parts](https://www.google.com/search?q=small+parts+case&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALiCzsbUx1lB4aglwNJBPvPJqoJsWEnsCg:1672631170434&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjyzoPW_Kf8AhULFlkFHUXHCboQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=2497&bih=1312&dpr=1) cases that are readily available at any hardware store. Why make it yourself when you could buy it for a fair price? Do you even understand 3D printing?! We do it because we can.

## Inspiration
This project combines several existing works:
- Alexandre Chappel's [Assortment Boxes](https://youtu.be/VntGnLuwoeY)
- Zack Freedman's [Gridfinity system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8)
- Kennetek's OpenSCAD [Gridfinity Rebuilt](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad) project.

If you want to keep things simple, Chappel has a great set of [plans and STLs](https://www.alch.shop/shop/assortment) for his Assortment system. This is a great solution if you don't want too much customization. However, the Gridfinity platform has **HUGE** community support with a large number of mods, derivatives, and compatible parts. I wanted to use the Chappel box idea, but with the Gridfinity system inside.

### This is my attempt to adapt Chappel's idea to work with Gridfinity.
